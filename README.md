I am [SKALE's](https://skale.space) VP of Developer Success and support across operations, prodcut strategy, marketing, and enterprise sales and partnerships.

I began my career as a software engineer building full-stack applications in JavaScript and mobile applciations in Flutter and Dark and over the years contracting for SKALE and working for a variety of other teams have picked up technical skills and languages like Typescript, Solidity, and Python. Working as a techncical consultant for many, my experiences cover everything from building developer tooling, launching mobile applications, building complex unit test suites both for normal software and smart contracts as well as more soft skills like translating business requirements into PRDs, taking products from 0-1, and designing architecture for customers.

I am passionate about solving problems for others across the entire lifecycle of products and companies through solutions architecture, product design, strategic operations, and actually building the products themselves.

### My work

I build a lot of different software and tools. While I spend more time focusing on developer tools or internal tooling for business operations; much of my closed-source software is user or business facing.
