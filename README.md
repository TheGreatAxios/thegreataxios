I am [SKALE's](https://skale.space) VP of Developer Success, supporting operations, product strategy, marketing, and enterprise sales and partnerships.

I began my career as a software engineer, building full-stack applications in JavaScript and mobile applications in Flutter and Dart. Over the years, contracting for SKALE and working with a variety of other teams, I’ve picked up technical skills and languages like TypeScript, Solidity, and Python. My experiences cover everything from building developer tooling, launching mobile applications, and creating complex unit test suites (both for standard software and smart contracts) to more strategic skills like translating business requirements into PRDs, taking products from 0-1, and designing architecture for customers.

I am passionate about solving problems for others across the entire lifecycle of products and companies through solutions architecture, product design, strategic operations, and hands-on building.

### My Work

I build a variety of software and tools. While I spend most of my time on developer tools or internal business operations tooling, much of my closed-source software is user- or business-facing.
